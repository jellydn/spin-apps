This repository contains three demo applications for Spin, written in Typescript, Go, and Rust. Each demo has its own README file with detailed instructions on how to run and use the application.

## [What is Spin](./Spin.md)

Spin is an open source framework for building and running fast, secure, and
composable cloud microservices with WebAssembly. It aims to be the easiest way
to get started with WebAssembly microservices, and takes advantage of the latest
developments in the
[WebAssembly component model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model)
and [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) runtime.
